# Layup Sequence

Refer to the `report.pdf` for the explanation and details of the code. The files can be run via the following commands (choose appropriate one for your system):
```bash
python <filename>
python3 <filename>
```
where `<filename>` is either `attempt.py`, `main.py`, or `optimized.py`. Again, refer to the report to understand the meanings of these programs.

All the programs report their runtime each time they are executed.

The solution to the task is in the file `S_10000.txt`. I didn't think including a plot of runtimes would add much value given my explanation/analysis in the report.
